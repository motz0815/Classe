The plugin for survival servers.

## Description
This is a work in progress. The goal is to have a complete and customizable experience for smaller survival servers
running Paper, Pufferfish or Purpur.

## Contributing
I would appreciate it if you filed issues or made pull requests, it helps a lot.
Feature requests are always welcome, too!

## Publication
As this project is currently in a very early stage, there are no official release archives available for download, though the newest builds can always be found on my Jenkins.
